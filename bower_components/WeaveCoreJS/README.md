# WeaveCoreJS

This library is ported from Weave AS3 version. It provides Session Framework for web application
Documentaion for how a variable can be sessioned for Session history will be updated soon

This library uses (Map) and (For - of) from E6

You need to enable e6 in Chrome browser(Javascript experimental features).
This project is tested only with Chrome.
